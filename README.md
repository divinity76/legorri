Lego Rock Raiders installer

# Usage
go to https://github.com/divinity76/legorri/releases and download the latest setup.exe release and run it, 
then go to legorr and run Cafeteria.exe :)

# Why
Turns out that installing Lego Rock Raiders on a modern OS is very hard! I'm trying to make that much easier.
Here is basically how to go about it: 
- obtain and install the base game somehow
- add the d3drm.dll to not crash on startup
- somehow remove the DRM system that make the game crash on modern OSs (for example by installing the LRR Masterpiece Editon Executable )
- install DgVoodoo so the game can actually talk to your modern graphics card
- add a fix for the no-cd-music loading issue so you don't have to play without music..
- add the Lego Rock Raiders Community Edition loader with crash fixes..
- add the Cafeteria Mod Manager for mods/higher resolutions/whatever

... alternatively you can use the installer from this project, which does all of that automatically.
