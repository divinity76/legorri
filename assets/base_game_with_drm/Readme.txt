ABOUT THIS README FILE
**********************

This file contains last-minute information that may not be in the manual.
If you are having a particular problem with the game, please see the section below, "Troubleshooting".

Please note:

LEGO Media International Limited does not accept any responsibility for any problems or issues encountered regarding the use of information contained within this readme file.

*****************
BASIC INFORMATION
*****************

Q: How do I install the game?

A: Place the LEGO Rock Raiders CD into your CD ROM drive.
The installation help screen will become active after a few seconds.
Follow the instructions that are displayed and you will be informed when the installation is complete.

Note:   If the autorun option does not active then this could be linked to the "Auto Insert Notification" function being disabled on your system. See "Troubleshooting" regarding this.
           
Q: How do I run the game?

A: It is advisable to restart your computer if you have been running any other applications, apart from the setup program. The game should always be played with as few other applications running as possible, and it is best to wait for hard disk activity to stop before running the game.
To run the game, click Start,Programs,LEGO Media,LEGO Rock Raiders. CD-ROM has to be present in the CD-ROM / DVD Drive for the game to run.

Q: How do I uninstall the game?

A: It is advisable to uninstall the game using the LEGO Rock Raiders Uninstall option. 
To uninstall the game, click Start, Programs,LEGO Media,LEGO Rock Raiders.

Note:	Any saved games regarding LEGO Rock Raiders will not be removed by using the uninstall option. These will have to be removed manually as follows: -

Double click with left-hand mouse button on "My Computer" icon
Double click on "C Drive" icon with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "Program Files" folder with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "LEGO Media" folder with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "Games" folder with left-hand mouse button
Single click on "Rock Raiders" folder with right-hand mouse button
Select "Delete" 
Choose "Yes" to confirm delete.

Q: What is 3D-hardware?

A: This is an optional component that maybe installed within your computer and is specifically designed to draw 3D scenes. 
Many new computers are shipped with such hardware, although it is fairly straightforward to buy 3D-hardware (Or a 3D-card) and install it yourself (you can ask your PC Dealer about this). This game will do its best to take advantage of any such 3D-Card installed in your computer.

Q: Should I have other programs running in the background of Windows.

A: Generally, we have found that it is not a good idea to run any other programs while running this game. Please turn off any active screen savers while running LEGO Rock Raiders, as they may interrupt the game and cause problems. 
Various video, sound, or memory issues may occur if other programs are running, including virus-detection utilities. This includes items that start from your StartUp folder which were added to load programs automatically when Windows is started, such as the Microsoft Office Toolbar. Some of these programs display icons on your taskbar. If you have icons on your taskbar, right-click on each of them and select the option to disable, unload, or close them before running LEGO Rock Raiders. The next time you start your computer, these items will load once more and the icons will return. If you cannot disable them from the taskbar and you experience problems running LEGO Rock Raiders you may want to remove the program shortcuts from the StartUp folder. For information about how to do this, please consult your Windows manual or your computer manufacturer.

***************
TROUBLESHOOTING
***************

Q. How do I check that the Screen Resolution is correct for this game?

A. Place your mouse pointer on a clear area within the Windows desktop screen and using the right hand mouse button click once. A menu will be displayed from which you need to select, using your left-hand mouse button, the "Properties" option. The "Display Properties" option folder is now shown and you need to select the "Settings" tab. Ensure that High Colour 16 bit option is set with the minimum recommended resolution area of 640 x 480. Apply any changes and re-start your machine.
  
Q: My mouse does not operate within the game.

A: The game requires a compatible Windows 95/98 compatible mouse and driver. It would be advisable to re-install the mouse using the Microsoft drivers for the mouse supplied with the Windows operating system or contact the mouse manufacturer for compatible Windows drivers.

Q. Autorun installation of game not activated when LEGO Rock Raiders CD is placed in CD ROM drive.

A. The Auto insert notification for your CD ROM drive must be set as active.
     To check that this option is activated see the following:
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "My Computer" Icon 
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "Control Panel" Icon
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "System" Icon
     Select "Device Manager" Tab
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "CD ROM Option" 
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "CD ROM drive"
     Select the "Settings Tab"
     Ensure that the Auto insert notification box has a tick in it.
     To confirm settings click onto "OK" option with left-hand mouse button.
  
Q. How do I check to ensure that all of my DirectX 6.1 drivers are certified?

A. Windows 95/98 with DirectX 6.1. With DirectX 6.1, you can check for a successful DirectX set-up by doing the following: 

Double click with left-hand mouse button on "My Computer" icon
Double click on "C Drive" icon with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "Program Files" icon with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "DirectX" folder with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "Setup" icon with left-hand mouse button
Double click on "DXDIAG" icon with left-hand mouse button
(Blue circle with yellow cross within it) 

The screen that appears has multiple tabs along the top. You will want to click on the DirectX Drivers tab. All of the drivers are listed separately and you will find a "Notes" field along the bottom. Within the notes field any problems encountered will be listed. If one or more of the items are listed as uncertified, this is most likely causing the problem you are having. Most often, the drivers that are not certified are either the Primary Display Driver and/or the Audio driver (Please Note: some manufacturers do not have certified drivers available for thier components, although the game may still run corectly). Most manufacturers of video cards and sound cards are releasing updated drivers for Windows 95/98 to meet the DirectX standard. You will want to contact the manufacturer of any component that is not supported and ask them about obtaining drivers that support DirectX.

Q: DXSetup Error -7 or -8

A: You may see the error DXSetup Error -7 or DXSetup Error -8 during the installation of DirectX if you do not have Audio Compression, Sound Recorder or Volume Control installed on your computer prior to installing DirectX 6.1 this could cause this error to appear.

Adding Sound Recorder, Volume Control and Audio Compression. The Sound Recorder, Volume Control and Audio Compression are necessary components of Windows when using DirectX 6.1 If they were not installed when Windows was set up, you will want to add them before installing LEGO Rock Raiders. DirectX will ask for your Windows CD during installation if it does not find these components, which may cause the DirectX installation to be incomplete and you may see the error DXSetup 
Error -7 or DXSetup Error -8 after changing to the Windows CD. If this happens, reboot your computer and follow these steps.

     To add these Windows components:

     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "My Computer" Icon 
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "Control Panel" Icon
     Double click using your left-hand mouse button on the "Add/Remove Programs"
     Select "Windows Setup" Tab
     Scroll down to Multimedia and select Details.
     Check the boxes next to Audio Compression, Sound Recorder and Volume 
     Control.
     Click OK, then OK again to close both of these windows. 
     You will be prompted for your Windows 95/98 CD.

When these steps are complete, you may continue with the installation of DirectX 6.1.

Q: What is DirectX?

A: The DirectX platform provides an environment that allows developers to use a standardised format when programming an application. This makes it easier to support a wide variety of different hardware features. Prior to DirectX, developers were forced to write hardware-specific code (With a specific driver for each different piece of hardware). DirectX is a library provided by Microsoft to run inside the operating system and provide programmers with seamless access to all of the hardware features available today.

NOTE:

We have found that some older systems may contain hardware that may not be fully DirectX compatible. For optimum performance in LEGO Rock Raiders, your system must fully support DirectX. Fortunately, many manufacturers are releasing updated drivers, although you may find that certain older cards are not supported any longer. 
If you are unsure whether or not your system will support DirectX, please contact the manufacturer of your system for more information.

DirectDraw

DirectDraw allows programmers to directly access video hardware and memory. This improves performance while still maintaining compatibility with Windows.

Direct3D

Direct3D provides direct access to 3D hardware. Direct3D is designed to work with the majority of 3D cards on the market, giving programmers an easier interface to your 3D hardware. Using Direct3D with your 3D accelerator can provide speed improvements as well as better image quality.

DirectSound

DirectSound is the wave-audio part of DirectX, which provides full functionality and hardware acceleration to the sound device. This allows for all the features of audio hardware to be used, including support for 3D positional and interactive sound.

DirectInput

DirectInput provides support for input devices including mice, keyboards, joysticks and other game controllers. Direct Input gives faster access to input data by communicating directly to the hardware driver rather than relying on Windows to do so.

DirectPlay

This is the multiplayer gaming module in DirectX, which provides access to networking functionality for gaming. DirectPlay supports direct serial connections, modem play, LAN play and Internet Play (Please Note: these features are not supported by this game).

DirectX Driver Issues

We suggest using the DirectX 6.1 drivers that are recommended during the installation of DirectX unless you experience problems after installing DirectX. The only time that this does not apply is when a section in this troubleshooting guide that pertains to your hardware specifically tells you to use a different driver. This is particularly true for video card drivers.

Effects of Video Card Driver Installation by DirectX
  
When DirectX is being installed, some video card utilities may be disabled, such as Diamond Multimedia's In Control Tools, STB Vision95, or Creative Labs Graphics Control utilities. You may no longer be able to access them through their taskbar icon and the options for changing your video properties may change back to standard Windows options. 
DirectX may not recommend changing the driver for your card at all because you may be using these utilities to customise your desktop display and removing them may have adverse effects on your computer.

3D-HARDWARE DRIVERS
*******************

Q: What is a 3D-hardware driver?

A: Also known as a 3D-card driver, it is part of the software interface that this game uses to communicate with the 3D-hardware in your computer. You may need to update your driver if the game is not running properly, e.g. if you see an error box when running the game, or the game doesn't run very smoothly, or the graphics appear to flicker.

Q: I need the latest driver for my 3D-hardware. How do I get it?

A: The best way is to download it using the Internet. Alternatively you could contact your 3D-hardware manufacturer or PC Dealer/Helpline and they should be able to send you a disk containing the latest driver.

Some sites for 3D-hardware drivers are:

http://www.drivershq.com 
http://www.download.com
http://www.3dfx.com (for 3Dfx based cards)

   - Uninstall and reinstall the Game.

2) Please make sure you have thoroughly read the "TROUBLESHOOTING" section above.

3) If you are still having problems, please see the "TECHNICAL SUPPORT" section below.

************
KNOWN ISSUES 
************

1. On 32MB machines the game may run slowly due to the in-game audio help. To overcome this there are 2 versions of LEGO Rock    Raiders on this CD. The first is STANDARD MODE for 32MB users and HIGH MODE for 64MB+ users. You can choose the desired      version from the START/PROGRAMS/LEGO MEDIA/ROCK RAIDERS path.
 
2. On certain graphics cards we have found that textures may appear corrupt. Certain cards come with utilities allowing the     user to alter texture memory, raising/lowering the texture memory can sometimes improve gamespeed.

3. If altering the utilities for your graphics card doesn't improve the performance, you can try one of the following          'command-line' instructions:  

                                -nosound (This will remove ALL sound except for video sequences in the game)
                                
                                -ftm (This makes you videocard use all available texture memory)
                                
                                -fvf (This can overcome 'fogging' on certain cards)

                                -reward (This disables the animation on the reward screen)

                                -nom (This disables texture management for Voodoo2 based cards)

   To add these one (or more) of these lines you must 'right click' on the LEGO Rock Raiders icon on your desktop and select    'Properties', you will then see the 'Target' line. Click in the box and then scroll with the 'right cursor arrow' until      you reach the end of the line, you should then press the 'space bar' once and then add the relevant 'command line'.

4. We have found that certain graphics cards are unable to handle the transparencies LEGO Rock Raiders uses and therefore       will display Grey or Black 'Boxes' at times. Unfortunatley, there is no way of recifying this other than to obtain updated    drivers from the manufacturer of the graphics card to see if this solves the issue.

5. You may find that the game takes a while to start once you run LEGO Rock Raiders, this is because the program installs the    main 'engine' and therefore take a while.
